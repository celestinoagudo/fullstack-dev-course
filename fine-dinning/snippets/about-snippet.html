        The company started wayback <strong>1945</strong>, after <strong>Hermohenes De Ezpadaña</strong> a well
        known chef in
        Spain befriended the Filipino - American occupation troops stationed at Sampaloc Manila.
        Because of this friendship, the group
        regularly visited Hermohenes’ nearby home for food and drinks they even requests Hermohenes for what food to
        eat.
      </p>

        Later on, the troops insisted that
        they pay for their foods and drinks. This prompted Hermohenes to open a canteen, where the group could enjoy
        foods and drinks.

        Later, an idea has arrived for Hermohenes to present foods for breakfast, lunch and supper where the group
        delightedly agreed.

        Over the years,<strong>Exquisite Cuisine</strong> Company’s popularity grew and it became known as
        <em>“Sta Mesa’s most acclaimed food subscription company.”</em>

      <p>
        Exquisite Cuisine has established itself as a household name in Manila, an institution, and a proud Spain
        tradition. The second and third
        generations of the family continue to zealously uphold the standards and traditions set by Hermohenes for
        all Exquisite Cuisine Branches.
